# TechnicianToolv1
A technician tool crafted with C# using the System and System Diagnostics library to make system changes and display system info

My Role: Using skills learned in C# and .NET to create a tool that runs natively on Windows and allows the user to run several useful system commands, run scripts, and programs.

Problem: Long ticket times, new technicians not knowing essential system commands to make system changes or view information.

Solution: An Exe file that is capable of executing 10 essential system commands almost instantly.  Reduced ticket times, ease-of-use improved for new technicians.

Additional changes to make:  Create a UI, add more commands, loop the program to ensure the box doesn't close.


How to use my solution: Paste the code into Visual Studio and Run.  Otherwise, export as an EXE file and share among windows computers.

*Note* The executable must be run as administrator to properly execute certain functions.

Update 1.1: Performance enhancements.

Enclosed block in a while loop - Added 'Continue' Statements to return to beginning of the loop - Added X as the condition to satisfy terminating the loop and exiting the program - Added message informing user of how to terminate program
